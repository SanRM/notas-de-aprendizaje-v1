# What Would You Say You Do Here?

## What Even Is a Staff Engineer?

* Senior level is "anchor" level for a career ladder. Levels below are for people to grow their autonomy; the levels above increase impact and responsibility.
* Senior is sometimes seen as the "tenure" level.
* Staff is the first rung of the "technical leadership" levels.
* Titles do matter.

## Why Do We Need Engineers Who Can See the Big Picture?

* Good decisions need *context*.
* The local maximum problem. Solved with decision makers (or decision influencers) who can take an outside view; consider the goals of multiple teams at once and choose a path that's best for the whole org or the whole business.
* Need to also anticipate how the decision will play out in the future (i.e., forward-looking decisions).
* Managers and CTO may not be best-fitted to be such decision makers because management authority can overshadow technical judgement and managing others is a full-time job.

## Why Do We Need Engineers Who Lead Projects That Cross Multiple Teams?

* Mention of bias to postpone or hand-wave the key decisions that need the most alignment.
* Solution is to have someone who feels ownership for the whole thing, rather than any of its individual parts. They scope out the work, build a proposal, author high-level system design, serve as a contact point for it, maintain high engineering standard, anticipate risks, ask hard questions. Informally mentor or coach other leads, unblock project. Telling the story of what's happening and why, selling the vision, explaining what the work will achieve.
* TPMs are responsible for delivery, not design and engineering quality.

## Why Do We Need Engineers Who Are a Good Influence?

* Staff Engineers are role models.
* Vocally celebrate other people's work, treat each other with respect, ask clarifying questions.

## You're Not a Manager, but You are a Leader

* Staff engineering is a leadership role.
* Projects that can't succeed without collaboration, communication, and alignment.
* Reference [Kind Engineering](https://kind.engineering/).

## You're in a "Technical" Role

* Deeply specialized leadership role.

## You Aim to Be Autonomous

* Your manager brings you information and shares context, but you should be telling them what's important just as much as the other way around.
* Reference [So You're Staff+ ... Now What?](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/so-youre-staff-now-what).

## You Set Technical Direction

* Job is not to come up with all (or even any) of the aspects of the technical direction, but to ensure there is an agreed-upon, well-understood solution that solves the problems it sets out to solve.

## You Communicate Often and Well

## Where in the Organization Do You Sit?

* Reporting chains affect level of support, information you're privy to, how you're perceived by colleagues outside your group.

### Reporting "high"

* Broad perspective.
* Info will be high-level and impactful, and so will the problems you're asked to solve.
* Manager will have less time, visibility, less likely to be your advocate or help you grow.

### Reporting "low"

* Manager will have more time, more likely to be an advocate, but less experienced.
* May find it hard to influence the org.
* Info will be filtered, centered on the problems of the specific team.
* Reference [When your manager isn't supporting you, build a voltron](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/)

## What's Your Scope?

* Inside your scope, you should have some influence on short-term and long-term goals. You should be aware of the major decisions being made.
* Get very clear on what your scope is, even if it's temporary or subject to change.

### A scope too broad

* Lack of impact
* Becoming a bottleneck
* Decision fatigue
* Missing relationships

### A scope too narrow

* Lack of impact
* Opportunity cost
* Overshadowing other engineers
* Over-engineering

## What Shape Is Your Role?

### Do you approach things depth-first or breadth-first?

* Very much about your personality and work style.

### Which of the "four disciplines" do you gravitate toward?

* Reference [Role and Influence: The IC trajectory beyond Staff](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/role-and-influence-ic-trajectory-beyond-staff).
* Core technical skills
* Product management
* Project management
* People management

### How much do you want (or need) to code?

* If you're going to feel antsy unless you're in code every day, make sure you're not taking on a broad architectural or influence-based role where you just won't have time.
* Or at least have a plan for how you're going to scratch that itch, so you'll be able to resist jumping on coding tasks and leaving the bigger problems to fend for themselves.

### How's your delayed gratification?

* Ask a manager who you trust to tell you, regularly and honestly, how things are going.

### Are you keeping one foot on the manager track?

* Tech lead manager (TLM).

### Do any of these archetypes fit you?

* Reference [Staff Archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes)
* Tech leads
* Architects
* Solvers
* Right hands

## What's Your Primary Focus?

* Most times you'll have autonomy in deciding what's important.

### What's important?

* Everything you do has a high opportunity cost, so your work needs to be important.

### What needs you?

## Aligning on Scope, Shape, and Primary Focus

* Write out your understanding of the job and share it with your manager.

## Is That Your Job?

* Your job is to make your organization successful (i.e., achieve its goals).

# Three Maps

* Locator map, topographical map, treasure map.

## Locator map

* Risks: prioritizing badly, losing empathy, tuning out the background noise (i.e., boiling frog), forgetting what the work is for.

### Seeing bigger

* Taking an outsider view
* Escaping the echo chamber. Seek out peers in other groups and build relationship with other roles (product, customer support, etc.)
* What's actually important?
* What do your customers care about? Reference to [No User Left Behind: Making Sure Customers Reach Your Service](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program/presentation/suley)
* Have your problems been solved before? Take the time to understand what already exists before building something new.

## Topographical Map

### Rought Terrain

* Your good ideas don't get traction
* You don't find out about the difficult parts until you get there
* Everything takes longer

### Understanding Your Organization

#### What's the culture?

* Statement of values or principles are aspirational.
* The real values of the company are reflected in what actually happens every day.
* Secret or open?
* Oral or written?
* Top-down or bottom-up?
* Fast change or deliberate change? Tied to written and oral culture.
* Back channels or front doors?
* Allocated or available?
* Liquid or crystallized? Mention of projects earmarked for promotion and ruffling feathers.

#### Power, rules, or mission?

* Reference to [A typology of organisational cultures](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22.short)
* Pathological: preoccupation with personal power, needs, and glory
* Bureaucratic: preoccupation with rules, positions, and departamental turf
* Generative: concentration of the mission itself
* Good practices: blameless postmortems, encouraging experimentation, taking calculated risks, breaking down silos.

#### Noticing the points of interest

* Chasms
* Fortresses
* Disputed territory
* Uncrossable deserts
* Paved roads, shortcuts, and long ways around

### What Points of Interest Are on Your Map?

#### How are decisions made?

#### Where is "the room"?

* Ask someone you trust to walk you through where a particular decision came from.

#### Asking to join in

* Show how including you will make your organization better at achieving its goals.
* Reference to [Getting in the Room](https://lethain.com/getting-in-the-room/).

#### The shadow org chart

* Reference to [Debugging Teams](https://book.debuggingteams.com/#manipulating_your_organization)

### Keeping Your Topographic Map Up to Date

* Automated announcement lists and channels
* Walking the floor
* Lurking
* Making time for reading
* Checking in with your leadership
* Talking with people

### If the Terrain Is Still Difficult to Navigate, Be a Bridge

## The Treasure Map

### Chasing Shiny Things

* It'll be harder to keep everyone going in the same direction
* You won't finish big things
* You'll accumulate cruft
* You'll have competing initiatives
* Engineers stop growing

### Taking a Longer View

#### Why are you doing whatever you're doing?

* Civilization video game analogy.

#### Sharing the map

* Where we are, where we're going, why we're taking the steps that we are along the way.

### If the Treasure Map Is Still Unclear, It Might Be Time to Draw a New One

## Your Personal Journey

* As a staff engineer, it can take longer to see the impact of your work.
* Looking back, you should have a narrative of what you were trying to achieve and how it went.
* Looking ahead, you should have a story of what you are trying to do.
* Trail map coming up in Chapter 9.

# Creating the Big Picture

## What's a Vision? What's a Strategy?

* "tragedy of the commons", another idiom for local maximum

### What's a Technical Vision?

* A technical vision describes the future as you'd like it to be once the objectives have been achieved and the biggest problems are solved.
* Also called a "north star".
* If you could wave a magic wand and be done, what would your architecture, processes, teams, culture, or capabilities be? That's your vision.

### What's a Technical Strategy?

* A strategy is a plan of action. It's how you intend to achieve your goals, navigating past the obstacles you'll meet along the way.
* It should bring clarity -- not about the destination, but about the path there.
* At it's kernel, it is a diagnosis of the problems, a guiding policy, and actions that will bypass the challenges.

#### The diagnosis

* Find patterns in the noise or using metaphors or mental models to make the problem easy to understand.
* This is difficult. It will take time.

#### Guiding policy

* The guiding policy is your approach to bypassing the obstacles described in the diagnosis.

#### Coherent actions

* Once you've got a diagnosis and guiding policy, you can get specific about the actions you're going to take and the ones you won't.
* A strategy should draw on your advantages.
* A strategy that can't get staffed in your organization is a waste of time.

### Do You Really Need Vision and Strategy Documents?

* If it's easy to describe the state that you're trying to get to or the problem you're trying to solve, what you actually want might be more like the goals section of a design document, or even the description of a pull request.
* Writing technical vision or strategy takes time. If you can achieve the same outcome in a more lightweight way, do that instead.

## The Approach

* There will be a ton of preparation, then a ton of iteration and alignment.
* The agreeement is the work.
* Mention of technology radar.

### Embrace the Boring Ideas

* Be prepared for your work to involve existing ideas, not brand-new ones.
* Someone who's willing to weight up all the possible solutions, make the case for what to do and not do, align everyone, and be brave enough to make the (potentially wrong) decisions.

### Join an Expedition in Progress

* Share the lead
* Follow their lead
* Step away

### Get a Sponsor

* A sponsor needs the power to decide what an organization spends time and staffing on, and such decisions are usually up to the local director or VP.
* A sponsor helps clarify and justify the work, adds hierarchy to groups that would otherwise get stuck at attempting consensus, set success criteria and act as a tiebreaker when decisions are stuck in committee.
* Mention of "objectives that are always true".

### Choose Your Core Group

* Working with other people gives you accountability.
* Aim to recruit a small core group (2-4 people) to help you create the document, as well as a broader group of general allies and supporters.
* Outside of the core team, you can offer more lightweight involvement: you'll interview them, try to represent their point of view in your work, and let them review early drafts.
* Lead vs. first among equals.

### Set Scope

* Consider how much the problems you are trying to solve sprawl across the organization.

### Make Sure It's Achievable

* Talk with someone who's done something similar before.

### Make It Official

Checklist:
* We need this.
* I know the solution will be boring and obvious.
* There isn't an existing effort (or I've joined it).
* There's organizational support.
* We agree on what we're creating.
* The problem is solvable (by me).
* I'm not lying to myself on any of the above.

## The Writing

### The Writing Loop

* Timebox this work and give yourself some deadlines.
* If you've set up milestones, use them as a reminder to stop iterating and wrap up.

#### Initial Ideas

* What documents already exist? "Inherit" any constraints they've set.
* What needs to change? Mention of "architectural characteristics".
* What's great as it is?
* What's important?
* What will Future You wish that Present You had done?

#### Writing

* Have the leader write a first draft for discussion.
* Aggregate multiple first drafts.

#### Interviews

* Put your preconceptions aside and talk to people. Lots of people.

#### Thinking

* Give yourself a lot of time to do that.
* Be open to shift in your thinking.
* Bias to describe a problem in terms of a solution you've already chosen.

### Make Decisions

#### Trade-offs

* Compare two positive attributes of the outcomes you want.

#### Building consensus

* Don't block on full consensus; lack of disagreement is more important than agreement.

#### Not deciding is a decision (just usually not a good one)

* Decisions constrain possibilities and make it possible to make progress.
* Remember that you don't need to make the best decision, just a good enough decision.

#### Show your work

* Document the decision, including the trade-offs you considered and how you got to the decision in the end.

### Get Aligned and Stay Aligned

#### Be Reasonable

* Mention of the "Overton window".

#### Nemawashi

* Mention of "nemawashi"; sharing information and laying the foundations so that by the time a decision is made, there's already consensus of opinion.

#### Work on your story

* You want a story that is comprehensible, relatable, and comfortable.

### Create the Final Draft

* Not everyone will be excited to review.
* Think about how you can make it easy to read, or share the highlights in another way.

## The Launch

### Make It Official

### Keep It Fresh

* Be prepared to revisit your document.

# Finite Time

## Doing All The Things

* Resources: time, energy, quality of life, credibility, social capital, skills.

### Time

* Everything you commit to has an opportunity cost.

#### Finite Time

* Put nonmeetings in the calendar too.

#### How Busy Do You Like to Be?

* Know how many hours you want to work on an average week, how many you're comfortable spiking to, and at what point you'll stop being able to handle the load and fall over.

## Resource Constraints

### Your Dashboard

* Five resources: energy, credibility, quality of life, skills, social capital.

#### Energy

* Understand what kinds of work are expensive for you, and what kinds will leave you with some smartbrain at the end of the day.

#### Quality of life

* The kind of work that you are doing and the people you are working with have a direct impact on your quality of life.

#### Credibility

* You won't be offered a difficult project or opportunity unless someone believes you can succeed at it.

#### Social Capital

* Social capital builds up over time, and you'll need more of it with some people than others.
* You'll want to stay on good term with the people in your reporting chain and build a track record of helping them achieve their goals.
* Invest your social capital wisely.

#### Skills

Increase skills in three main ways.
* Deliberately setting out to learn something.
* Working closely with someone who is really skilled.
* Learning by doing.

### E + 2S + ... ?

#### Bin packing

* Reference to [bin-packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem).

## Choosing Projects

### Evaluating a Project

* You're invited to join
* You ask to join
* You have an idea
* The fire alarm goes off
* You're claiming a problem
* You're invited to join a grassroots effort
* Someone needs to ...
* You're just meddling

### What are you signing on for?

* Exit criteria are especially important for work that is risky or that you're not sure you should be doing at all.
* You can reduce that risk by including formal go/no-go or retrospective points, or framing things explicitly as a timeboxed experiment.

### Questions to Ask Yourself About Projects

#### Energy: How many things are you already doing?

* Juggling balls and choose your battles analogies.

#### Energy: Does this kind of work give or take energy?

#### Energy: Are you procrastinating?

* Reference to [The first rule of prioritization: No snacking](https://www.intercom.com/blog/first-rule-prioritization-no-snacking).
* Beware of the low effort, low impact quadrant.

#### Energy: Is this fight worth it?

* Reference to [OPP (Other People's Problems)](https://skamille.medium.com/opp-other-peoples-problems-d7eb174724ee).

#### Quality of life: Do you enjoy this work?

* Enough excitement vs. enough predictability.
* Working alone vs. working with others.
* Pair programming.
* On-call.
* Travel.
* Publicly sharing what you learn (conference talks, etc.)
* Comfortable and safe.

#### Quality of life: How do you feel about the project's goals?

* Value-aligned work.

#### Credibility: Does this project use your technical skills?

* i.e., opportunity to get down in the trenches

#### Credibility: Does this project show your leadership skills?

* Evaluate new projects for what kind of skills they're going to let you demonstrate and how succeeding will reflect on you.

#### Social capital: Is this the kind of work that your company and your manager expects at your level?

* Reference to [Managing Up](https://leaddev.com/communication-relationships/myths-and-traps-managing).

#### Social capital: Will this work be respected?

* Value-aligned work, but extended to peers.

#### Social capital: Are you squandering the capital you've built?

* Applicable to work and sponsorship.

#### Social capital: Will this project teach you something you want to learn?

* What stories do you want to be able to tell on your future resume?

#### Skills: Will the people around you raise your game?

* Reference to [Observational learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_learning).
* Look at whether you'll work with people you'll learn something from, and people who will inspire you to do your best work.

## What If It's the Wrong Project?

### Do it anyway?

* If you’ve been doing projects that aren’t good for you and there’s no end in sight, this is a good conversation to have with your manager.

### Compensate for the project

* Sometimes you have to torch the back burner.

### Let others lead

* A leader's job is to "aggressively delegate".
* Reference to [The New Manager Death Spiral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAbU3WJ-NBw).
* Do a gut check for whether someone else needs the project more.

### Resize the project

* If a project were interesting to you with some modifications, it's usually worth talking about that.

### Just don't do it

* Saying 
* Reference to [10 ways to politely say no](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/grammar-vocabulary/story/10-ways-to-politely-say-no-1505465-2019-04-19) and [How to say no to a work request](https://www.askamanager.org/2015/04/how-to-say-no-to-a-work-request.html).

# Leading Big Projects

## The Life of a Project

## The Start of a Project

### If You're Feeling Overwhelmed ...

* It is normal to feel overwhelmed when you're beginning a project.
* It takes time and energy to build the mental maps that let you navigate it all.
* Mention of impostor syndrome.
* Possible signal of being low on energy, time, skills. Think about ways to increase the levels of these resources.
* The difficulty and the ambiguity are the nature of the work.

#### Create an anchor for yourself

* Create a document, just for me, that's going to act as an external part of my brain for the duration of the project.

#### Talk to your project sponsor

* Meet with project sponsor with a written description of what you think they are hoping to achieve from the project and what success looks like. Confirm you are on the right track, or write down clarified ambiguity.
* Clarify what your role will be and who you should bring project updates to.

#### Decide who gets your uncertainty

* Try to find at least one person who you can be open and unsure with; your manager, a mentor, or a peer.
* Choose a sounding board who will listen, validate, and say "Yes, this stuff is hard for me too". Be that person for them or others too.

#### Give yourself a win

* If the problem is still too big, aim to take a step, any step, that helps you exert some control over it.

#### Use your strengths

* You're going to want to pour a lot of information into your brain as efficiently as possible, so use your core muscles. Be it coding, talking to people, reading documents.

### Building Context

#### Goals

* Out of all the possible business goals, technical investments, pending tasks, why is this the one that's happening?
* The "why" is going to be a motivator and a guide throughout the project.

#### Customer needs

* If you don't understand what your customers need, you're not going to build the right thing.
* Budget time to figure that out.
* Reference to [Working with Product Managers: Advice from PMs](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/working-with-product-managers-advice-from-pms).

#### Success metrics

* Mention of product requirements document (PRD).
* Make sure sponsor and other leads agree on them.

#### Sponsors, stakeholders, and customers

* Clarify for yourself who your first customer or main stakeholder is, what they're hoping to see from you, and when.

#### Fixed constraints

* Usually you're going to be constrained in some ways: understand what those constraints are.
* Describe the reality of the situation you're in, so you won't spend all your time being mad at reality not being as you wish it to be.

#### Risks

* Try to predict some risks. What could happen that could prevent you from your goals on deadline?

#### History

* Don't just jump in.
* Have a lot of conversations.
* Find out what half-built systems you're going to have to use, work around, or clean up before you can start creating a new solution.
* Understand people's feelings and expectations, and learn from their experiences.
* Reference to Amazon's tenet to ["Respect what came before"](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/pe-community-tenets).

#### Team

* Don't waste your time in power struggles.
* Understand who the leaders are, how they're involved in the project, and what role they expect to play.

### Giving Your Project Structure

#### Defining roles

* Create a table of leadership responsibilities and lay out who should take on each one.
* Try to get every leader aligned on what your roles are and who's doing what.

#### Recruiting people

* If there are unfilled roles that you don't want to do or don't have time to do, you may have to find someone else to do them.

#### Agreeing on scope

* "Fast, cheap, good: Pick two".
* If you have multiple use cases or features, you'll want to deliver incremental value along the way. So decide what you're doing first, set a milestone, and put a date beside it.
* Make the increments small enough that there's always a milestone in sight: it's motivational to have a goal that feels reachable.
* If the project is big enough, you might split the work into work streams, chunks of functionality that can be created in parallel, each with its own set of milestones.
* You might also describe different phases, where you complete a huge piece of work, reorient, and then kick off the next stage of the project.

#### Estimating time

* Reference to [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/).
* Estimating time needs to include thinking about teams you depend on. Talk with the teams you'll need as early as possible, and understand their availability.

#### Agreeing on logistics

* When, where, and how you'll meet
* How you'll encourage informal communication
* How you'll all share status
* Where the documentation home will be
* What your development practices will be

## Driving the Project

Reference to [Avoid the Lake](https://leaddev.com/agile-other-ways-working/avoid-lake).

### Exploring

* If you're creating a design where it's difficult to articulate the goals (or if the goals are just a description of your implementation!), that's a sign you haven't spent enough time in this exploration stage.

#### What are the important aspects of the project?

* Aligning and framing the problem can take time and effort.
* Exploring helps you form an elevator pitch about the project, a way to sum it up and reduce it to its most important aspects.

#### What possible approaches can you take?

* Once you have a clear story for what you're trying to do, only then figure out how to do it.
* Be open to existing solutions too, and learn from their history.

### Clarifying

* As the project lead, you have an incentive to spend time understanding the tricky concepts if it helps you achieve your project. But the people you ask for help have a different focus and may not try as hard. Unless you take the time to reduce the complexity for them, they could end up thinking about the project in a way that leads them to optimize for the wrong outcome or muddy a clear story you're trying to tell your organization.
* Reference to [The Art of Travel](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/the-art-of-travel/summary).

#### Mental models

* Connecting an abstract idea back to something I understand well removes some cognitive cost of retaining and describing the idea.
* We can build abstractions to let us work with ideas.
* Help others build mental models by providing convenient, memorable name for the concept, using an analogy, or connecting it back to something they already understand.

#### Naming

* Reference to [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) and `ubiquitous language`.

#### Pictures and graphs

* There is no easier way to help people visualize what you're talking about than with pictures, graphs or charts.

### Designing

* You'll need to make sure everyone is aligned. The most efficient way to do that is to write things down.

#### Why share designs?

* Include the most important aspects of the plan, and let other people get in touch with you if they see hazards in your path.
* Validate the feasibility of an architecture or a series of steps; includes agreeing on whether you are solving the right problem at all and whether your assumptions about the other teams and existing systems are correct.

#### What goes in an RFC?

* Context. Include status (early idea, open for detailed review, etc.).
* Goals. Explain why we are doing this at all; show what problem you're trying to solve or what opportunity you're trying to take advantage of. Should not include implementation details. The specific implementation should serve the goal; it should not be the goal.
* Design. Lays out how you intend to achieve the goal. At the end, your readers should understand what you intend to do and should be able to tell you whether they think it will work. Reference to ["What I Think About When I Edit"](https://evaparish.com/blog/how-i-edit).
* Security/privacy/compliance.
* Alternatives considered/prior art.
* Background.
* Trade-offs.
* Risks.
* Dependencies.
* Operations.

#### Technical pitfalls

* It's a brand-new problem (but it isn't). Don't miss the opportunity to learn from other people, and consider reusing existing solutions.
* This looks easy!
* Building for the present
* Building for the distant, distant future
* Every user just needs to... Any part of your solution that involves humans changing their workflows or behavior will be difficult and needs to be part of the design.
* We'll figure out the difficult part later
* Solving the small problem by making the big problem more difficult
* It's not really a rewrite (but it is!)
* But is it operable?
* Discussing the smallest decisions the most

## Coding

### Should you code on the project?

* Reference to [Should Staff+ Engineers Be Writing Code?](https://jkebertz.medium.com/should-staff-engineers-be-writing-code-1237abf891f4).
* Avoid snacking.

### Be an exemplar, but not a bottleneck

* If you're coding, try to pick work that's not time-sensitive or on the critical path.
* Reference to [99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles).
* Analogy of "scouting and cartography".
* Find opportunities for other people to grow, by chatting over the details or pair programming on the change.
* Whatever you do will set expectations for the team.

## Communicating

* Communicating well is key for delivering a project in time.

### Talking to each other

* Find opportunities for your team members to talk with each other regularly and build relationships.
* Goals are to make team members comfortable to disagree without it getting tense and ask clarifying questions.

### Sharing status

* Make it easy to find out what's going on, and set expectations about when you'll reach various milestones.
* Explain your status in terms of impact and what the audience will actually want to know.
* Analogy of watermelon project.

## Navigating

* Expect problems to arise. Make plans accordingly.

# Why Have We Stopped

## The Project Isn't Moving - Should It Be?

* As a leader in your organization, you can help projects that you're not leading too. Reference to [Work on What Matters](https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters/).
* Choose the opportunities where your help is most valuable, and then take deliberate action, with a plan for stepping away again afterward.
* Techniques: 1. understand and explain, 2. make the work easier, 3. get organizational support, 4. make alternative plans

### You're Stuck in Traffic

### Blocked by Another Team

#### What's going on?

* Misunderstandings
* Misadventure
* Misalignment

#### Navigating the dependency

### Blocked by a Decision

#### What's going on?

* Mention of different contexts and different domain languages when working with non-engineers.

#### Navigating the unmade decision

### Blocked by a Single $%@$% Button Click

#### What's going on?

* "lack of planning on your part is not an emergency on mine"
* Bear in min that other teams often take on accountability when they give approval.

#### Navigating the un-clicked button

### Blocked by a Single Person

#### What's going on?

* The reasons your colleague gives you for being blocked aren't necessarily the real ones.

#### Navigating a colleague who isn't doing the work

* Reassure them what they're working on is legitimately difficult but learnable. Help them, but try not to take over. Ask questions, answer questions, and help them find their way.

### Blocked by Unassigned Work

#### What's going on?

* An example of plate tectonics problem.

#### Navigating the unassigned work

* Reference to [the art of the rollup](https://twitter.com/deniseyu21/status/1357832805653356546).

### Blocked by a Huge Crowd of People

#### What's going on?

#### Navigating the half-finished migration

## You're Lost

### You Don't Know Where You're All Going

#### What's going on?

#### Choosing a destination

* Clarify roles.
* Choose a strategy. Until you all agree on exactly what problem you're solving, nobody is allowed to discuss implementation details. Pick a small number of challenges, and leave the other real problems unsolved for now.
* Choose a problem.
* Choose a stakeholder. Aim to solve in "vertical slices".

### You Don't Know How to Get There

#### What's going on?

#### Finding the way

* Articulate the problem
* Revisit your assumptions
* Give it time
* Increase your capacity
* Look for prior art
* Learn from other people
* Try a different angle
* Start smaller
* Ask for help. Coworkers, mentors, or local experts.

### You Don't Know Where You Stand

#### What's going on?

#### Getting back on solid ground

* Clarify organizational support
* Clarify roles
* Ask for what you need
* Refuel

## You Have Arrived ... Somewhere?

### But it is Code Complete!

#### What's going on?

* The want to catch a Pokémon analogy.

#### Making sure the user can catch a Pokemon

* Define "done"
* Be your own user. Reference to dogfooding.
* Celebrate landings, not launches.

### It's Done but Nobody Is Using It

#### What's going on?

#### Selling it

* Reference to [Why Marketing Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hykHdV0So6M).
* Tell people.
* Make it discoverable

### It's Built on a Shaky Foundation

#### What's going on?

#### Shoring up the foundations

* Set a culture of quality.
* Make the foundational work a user story.
* Negotiate for engineer-led time.

### The Project Just Stops Here

#### This is a better place to stop

#### It's not the right journey to take

* Mention of sunk cost fallacy.

#### The project has been canceled

### This is the destination!

* Take the time to mark the occasion and make your success feel special.
* Consider a retro.
* Celebrate aspects of your culture that you most appreciate.

# You're a Role Model Now (Sorry)

## What Does It Mean to do a good job?

### Values Are What You Do

* Engineering goes beyond what you do when you're talking to computer systems; it's also how you talk to humans.

### But I Don't Want to be a Role Model!

* Be the best engineer and the best colleague that you can be.

## What Does it Mean to Do a Good Job as a Senior Engineer?

* Be competent.
* Be a responsible adult.
* Remember the goal.
* Look ahead.

### Be Competent

### Know Things

* You can't be a technical leader without the "technical" part.
* Your big-picture thinking, project execution, credibility, and influence are underpinned by knowledge and experience.

#### Build experience

* Experience comes through time, exposure, and study.
* It takes time. Invest time - lots of time in honing your technical skills.
* There is no substitute for working through problems, learning your own techniques for solving them, and seeing what works and what doesn't.
* Staff engineers have at least 10 YOE. Don't rush past your prime learning years.

#### Build domain knowledge

* When you move into a new technology area or business domain, be deliberate about learning quickly.

#### Stay up to date

* Growth mindset and drive to improve.
* Stay engaged with what's happening in your part of the industry.
* Show that you're learning. Be open about what you're learning, and show how you're doing it.

### Be Self-Aware

* The self-awareness to know what you can do, how long it will take, and what you don't know.
* Having well-founded confidence that you'll be able to solve the problem.

#### Admit what you know

* Aim to get to a level where you're confident and honest with yourself about what you know and what you don't.

### Have High Standards

* Know what high-quality work looks like and aim for that standard in everything you do.

#### Seek out constructive criticism

* Look for opportunities to put aside your ego and ask someone else to help make your work better.
