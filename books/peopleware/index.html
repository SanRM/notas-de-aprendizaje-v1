prone to one particular failing: a tendency to manage people as though they were modular components.</p> <h3 id="failing-projects"> <a href="#failing-projects" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="failing-projects"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Failing projects </h3> <p>The cause of failure most frequently cited by our survey participants was “politics”, a.k.a. the project’s <em>sociology</em>.</p> <p>By noting the true nature of a problem as sociological rather than political, you make it more tractable.</p> <blockquote> <p>The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="the-high-tech-illusion"> <a href="#the-high-tech-illusion"

stem from good human interactions by all participants in the effort, and our failures stem from poor human interactions.</p> <p>The main reason we tend to focus on the technical rather than the human side of the work is because it’s easier to do.</p> <h3 id="make-a-cheeseburger-sell-a-cheeseburger"> <a href="#make-a-cheeseburger-sell-a-cheeseburger" class="anchor-heading"

“make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger” mentality only serves to damp your people’s spirits and focus their attention away from the real problems at hand. To manage thinking workers effectively you need to take measures.</p> <h4 id="a-quota-of-errors"> <a href="#a-quota-of-errors" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="a-quota-of-errors"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> A quota of errors </h4> <p>Making an occasional mistake is natural and healthy. Fostering an atmosphere that doesn’t allow for error simply makes people defensive. Encourage people to make some errors. Ask your folks on occasion what dead-ends roads they’ve been down.</p> <h4 id="management-the-bozo-definition"> <a href="#management-the-bozo-definition" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="management-the-bozo-definition"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Management: The bozo definition </h4> <p>“Management is kicking ass” mentality might work for cheeseburger production, but won’t for any effort which people do work with their heads rather than their hands.</p> <h4 id="the-people-store"> <a href="#the-people-store" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-people-store"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The people store </h4> <p>Many managers convince themselves that no one is irreplaceable. That there is no such thing as a key person. The <em>people</em> manager realizes that uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective.</p> <h4 id="a-project-in-steady-state-is-dead"> <a href="#a-project-in-steady-state-is-dead" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="a-project-in-steady-state-is-dead"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> A project in steady state is dead </h4> <p>The only steady state of a project is rigor mortis.

Productivity means achieving more in an hour of work, extracting more for an hour of pay. Attaining new productivity levels through the simple mechanism of unpaid overtime.</p> <h4 id="the-aint-no-such-thing-as-overtime"> <a href="#the-aint-no-such-thing-as-overtime" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-aint-no-such-thing-as-overtime"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The ain’t no such thing as overtime </h4> <p>There will be more or less an hour of undertime for every hour of overtime. For the long term it will cancel out.</p> <p>Nobody can work more than forty hours with the level of intensity required for creative intellectual work. Overtime is like sprinting.</p> <h4 id="workaholics"> <a href="#workaholics" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="workaholics"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Workaholics </h4> <p>Workaholics will put in uncompensated overtime.</p> <p>The realization that one has sacrificed a more important value (family, love, home, youth) for a less important value (work) is devastating. These profiles will eventually realise this and they will be gone.</p> <p>You can’t let them do so at the expense of their personal lives. The loss of a good person isn’t worth it.</p> <h4 id="productivity-winning-battles-and-losing-wars"> <a href="#productivity-winning-battles-and-losing-wars" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="productivity-winning-battles-and-losing-wars"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Productivity: Winning battles and losing wars </h4> <p>Productivity has to be defined as benefit divided by cost.

When you feel them, there is always passion involved. The slightest challenge to one of these built-in values can be upsetting.</p> <p>We tend to tie our self-esteem strongly to the quality of the product we produce. Not the <em>quantity</em> of product, but the <em>quality</em>. <strong>Any step you take that may jeopardize the quality of the product is likely to set the emotions of your staff directly against you.</strong></p> <h4 id="the-flight-from-excellence"> <a href="#the-flight-from-excellence" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-flight-from-excellence"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The flight from excellence </h4> <p>Workers kept under extreme time pressure will begin to sacrifice quality. They will hate what they’re doing. The decision to pressure people into delivering a product that doesn’t measure up to their own quality standards is almost a mistake.</p> <p>We have to assume that people who pay for our work are of sound enough mind to make sensible trade-off between quality and cost.</p> <p>Allowing the standard of quality to be set by the buyer, rather than the builder, is what we call <em>the flight from excellence</em>.</p> <p>In the long run, market-based quality costs more.</p> <blockquote> <p>Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity.</p> </blockquote> <p>How is it possible that higher quality coexists with higher productivity?</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The trade-off between price and quality does not exist in japan.

Quality identification works for increased job satisfaction and some of the lowest turnover figures.</p> <p>The team can insist that delivery wait until its own standards are achieved.</p> <h3 id="parkinsons-law-revisited"> <a href="#parkinsons-law-revisited" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="parkinsons-law-revisited"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Parkinson’s law revisited </h3> <blockquote> <p>Work expands to fill the time allocated for it</p> </blockquote> <p>Some managers have a strong conviction that the only way to get work done at all is to set an impossibly optimistic delivery date.</p> <h4 id="parkinsons-law-and-newtons-law"> <a href="#parkinsons-law-and-newtons-law" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="parkinsons-law-and-newtons-law"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Parkinson’s law and Newton’s law </h4> <p>Parkinson’s law is not a law in the same sense that Newton’s law is a law.

Programmers work harder to meet the analyst’s estimate, bad estimates are always a demotivating factor. The systems analysts tends to be a better estimator than either the programmer or the supervisor. Tight estimates sap the builders’ energy.</p> <p>The surprising part of the 1985 Jeffrey-Lawrence study is that no estimates outperformed all others. Projects on which the boss applied no schedule pressure whatsoever (“Just wake me up when you’re done”) had the highest productivity of all.</p> <p><strong>Schedule pressure needs to be made in much the same way you decide whether or not to punish your child.</strong></p> <h4 id="variation-on-a-theme-by-parkison"> <a href="#variation-on-a-theme-by-parkison" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="variation-on-a-theme-by-parkison"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Variation on a theme by Parkison </h4> <blockquote> <p>Organizational busy work tends to expand to fill the working day</p> </blockquote> <p>Becoming worse every year, is frightening true in many organizations.

Game results won’t be used against you, security and confidentiality should be guaranteed.</p> <p>War games help you evaluate your relative strengths and weaknesses and help the organization to observe its global strengths and weaknesses.</p> <h4 id="brainstorming"> <a href="#brainstorming" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="brainstorming"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Brainstorming </h4> <p>Structured interactive session, specifically targeted on creative insight. People get together to focus on a relevant problem. Strive for quantity of ideas, not quality. Discourage negative comments.</p> <h4 id="training-trips-conferences-celebrations-and-retreats"> <a href="#training-trips-conferences-celebrations-and-retreats" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="training-trips-conferences-celebrations-and-retreats"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Training, trips, conferences, celebrations and retreats </h4> <p>Combining travel with their peers and one-of-a-kind experience. Better if the travel is to somewhere exotic.</p> <p>When a team is forming, it makes good business sense to fight for travel money to get team members out of the office together.</p> <h3 id="free-electrons"> <a href="#free-electrons" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="free-electrons"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Free electrons </h3> <p>The mark of the best manager is an ability to single out the few key spirits who have the proper mix of perspective and maturity and then turn them loose. Their own direction is more unerringly in the best interest of the organization than any direction might come down from above. It’s time to get out of their way.</p> <p><strong>Sociology matters more than technology or even money. It’s supposed to be productive, satisfying fun to work. If it isn’t, then there’s nothing else worth concentrating on.</strong></p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
