aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Solving an agile manager’s dilemma </h2> <blockquote> <p>Our deadlines were set by managers without regard to engineering complexity, risk, or project size.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Changes suggested out of context would be rejected by the workers who lived and understood the project context.</p> </blockquote> <p>Drum-Buffer-Rope is an example of a class of solutions known as pull systems. The side effect of pull systems is that they limit work-in-progress (WIP) to some agreed-upon quantity, thus preventing workers from becoming overloaded.</p> <h2 id="kanban"> <a href="#kanban" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="kanban"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Kanban </h2> <p><em>Kan-ban</em> is a Japanese word that literally means “signal card” in english. Cards are used as a signal to tell an upstream step in the process to produce more. Kanban is fundamental to the <em>kaizen</em> (continuous improvement).</p> <p>Workflow visualisation, work item types, cadence, classes of service, specific management reporting, and operation reviews is what defines the Kanban Method.</p> <h3 id="kanban-system"> <a href="#kanban-system" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="kanban-system"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Kanban system </h3> <p>A number of cards equivalent to the agreed capacity of a system are placed in circulation. One card attaches to one piece of work. Each card acts as a signalling mechanism. A new piece of work can be started only when a card is available. The free card is attached to a piece of work and follows it as it flows through the system. When there are no more free cards, no additional work can be started. Any new work must wait in a queue until a card becomes available. When some work is completed, its card is detached and recycled. With a card now free, a new piece of work in the queuing can be started.</p> <p>This is known as a pull system because new work is pulled into the system when there is capacity to handle it, rather being pushed into the system based on demand. A pull system cannot be overloaded if capacity, as determined by the number of signal cards in circulation, has been set appropriately.</p> <h3 id="kanban-in-software-development"> <a href="#kanban-in-software-development" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="kanban-in-software-development"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Kanban in software development </h3> <p>In software development the cards do not actually function as signals to pull more work. They represent work items.</p> <p>Card walls have become a popular visual control mechanism. These are not inherently Kanban systems, they are merely visual control systems. <strong>If there is no explicit limit to work-in-progress and no signalling to pull new work through the system, it is not a Kanban system.</strong></p> <h3 id="why-use-kanban"> <a href="#why-use-kanban" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="why-use-kanban"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Why use Kanban </h3> <p>We use it in order to limit team’s work-in-progress to a set capacity and to balance the demand on the team. By providing visibility onto quality and process problems, it makes obvious the impact of defects, bottlenecks, variability, and economic costs on flow and throughput.</p> <p>Kanban facilitates emergence of a highly collaborative, high-trust, highly empowered, continuously improving organisation.</p> <h3 id="kanban-and-lean"> <a href="#kanban-and-lean" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="kanban-and-lean"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Kanban and Lean </h3> <p>Kanban uses five core properties to create an emergent set of Lean behaviours in organisations:</p> <ul> <li>Visualise workflow</li> <li>Limit work-in-progress</li> <li>Measure and manage flow</li> <li>Make process policies explicit</li> <li>Use models to recognise improvement opportunities (like Theory of Constraints, Systems Thinking, <em>muda</em>)</li> </ul><hr /> <p>Kanban is not a software development lifecycle methodology or an approach to project management. It requires that some process is already in place so that Kanban can be applied to incrementally change the underlying process.</p> <p>Your situation is unique and you deserve to develop a unique process definition tailored and optimised to your domain.</p> <h2 id="recipe-for-success"> <a href="#recipe-for-success" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="recipe-for-success"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Recipe for success </h2> <p>Asking people to change their behaviour creates fear and lowers self-esteem, as it communicates that existing skills are clearly no longer valued.</p> <p>The recipe for success presents guidelines for a new manager adopting a new existing team.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Focus on quality</strong>: Excessive defects are the biggest waste in software development. <ul> <li>Both agile and traditional approaches to quality have merit</li> <li>Code inspections improve quality</li> <li>Collaborative analysis and design improve quality</li> <li>The use of design patterns improves quality</li> <li>The use of modern development tools improves quality</li> <li>Reducing the quality of design-in-progress boosts software quality</li> </ul> </li> <li>Reduce work-in-progress</li> <li>Deliver often</li> <li>Balance demand against throughput</li> <li>Prioritise</li> <li>Attack sources of variability to improve predictability</li> </ul> <p>Working down the list, there is gradually less control and more collaboration required with other downstream and upstream groups. The final step it’s the one that separates the truly great technical leaders from the merely competent managers.</p> <h3 id="wip-lead-time-and-defects"> <a href="#wip-lead-time-and-defects" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="wip-lead-time-and-defects"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> WIP, lead time, and defects </h3> <p>Longer lead times (from starting to done) seem to be associated with significantly poorer quality. In fact, an approximately 6.5x increase in average lead time resulted in greater than 30x in initial defects. Longer average lead times result from greater amounts of work-in-progress. Hence, the management leverage point for improving quality is to reduce the quantity of work-in-progress. <strong>Shorter iterations will drive higher quality.</strong></p> <h3 id="frequent-releases-build-trust"> <a href="#frequent-releases-build-trust" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="frequent-releases-build-trust"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Frequent releases build trust </h3> <p>Reducing WIP shortens lead time and frequent releases build trust with external teams (social capital). Trust is event driven and that small, <strong>frequent gestures or events enhance trust more than larger gestures made only occasionally.</strong></p> <p>Small gestures often cost nothing but build more trust than large, expensive gestures bestowed occasionally.</p> <h3 id="tacit-knowledge"> <a href="#tacit-knowledge" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="tacit-knowledge"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Tacit knowledge </h3> <p>Information discovery in software development is tacit in nature and is created during collaborative working sessions, face-to-face. Our minds have a limited capacity to store all this tacit knowledge. Knowledge depreciates with time, so shorter lead times are essential.</p> <h3 id="balance-demand-against-throughput"> <a href="#balance-demand-against-throughput" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="balance-demand-against-throughput"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Balance demand against throughput </h3> <p>By setting the rate at which we accept new requirements, we are effectively fixing our work-in-progress to a given size.

Optimising for utilisation is not desirable.</p> <h3 id="prioritise"> <a href="#prioritise" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="prioritise"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Prioritise </h3> <p>At this point, management attention can turn to optimising the value delivered rather than merely the quantity of code delivered.</p> <p><strong>Prioritisation should not be controlled by engineering.</strong> Improving prioritisation requires the product owner, business sponsor, or marketing department.

Then reduce the work-in-progress, shorten lead times, and release often. Next, balance demand against throughput, limit work-in-progress, and create slack to free up bandwidth, which enable improvements. Then, with a smoothly functioning and optimising software development capability, improve prioritisation to optimise value delivery.</p> <h3 id="attack-sources-of-variability-to-improve-predictability"> <a href="#attack-sources-of-variability-to-improve-predictability" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="attack-sources-of-variability-to-improve-predictability"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Attack sources of variability to improve predictability </h3> <p>Reducing variability in software development requires knowledge workers to change the way they work, to learn new techniques and change their personal behaviour.

Individuals feel free to take action; free to do the right thing without fear. Management is tolerant with failure and individuals are free to self-organise around the work they do and how they do it. Everyone looks out for the performance of the team and the business above themselves.</p> <p>A kaizen culture has a high level of social capital, a trusting culture where individuals respect each other. High-trust cultures tend to have flatter structures than lower-trust cultures. It is the degree of empowerment that enables a flatter structure to work effectively. Achieving kaizen culture may enable elimination of wasteful layers of management and reduce coordination costs as a result.</p> <p><strong>Introducing a radical change is harder than incrementally improving an existing one.</strong></p> <h3 id="unanticipated-effects-of-introducing-kanban"> <a href="#unanticipated-effects-of-introducing-kanban" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="unanticipated-effects-of-introducing-kanban"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Unanticipated effects of introducing Kanban </h3> <blockquote> <p>The physical board had a huge psychological effect.

The main change will be quantity of WIP and the interface to add interaction with upstream and downstream parts of your business. So you must work with your team to map the value stream as it exists.

Involving answering three questions: <strong>What did you achieve yesterday? What will you do today? Are you blocked or do you need assistance?</strong></p> <p>In Kanban, the wall contains all the information so the focus will be on the flow of work. The facilitator will “walk the board”. Work backward, from right to left (in direction of the pull), through the tickets on the board. Making emphasis on items that are blocked, delayed due to defects or stuck for a few days. There will also a call for any other blocking issues that are not on the board and for anyone who needs help to speak up. Mature teams do not need to walk through every card.

Existing processes will be optimised through introduction of visualisation and limiting work-in-progress to catalyse changes.</li> <li><strong>Goal 2: Deliver with high quality</strong>. Limiting WIP and allowing us to define policies around what is acceptable before a work item can be pulled to the next step in the process.</li> <li><strong>Goal 3: Improve lead time predictability</strong>. The amount of WIP is directly related to lead time, so keep WIP small.</li> <li><strong>Goal 4: Improve employee satisfaction</strong>. There is a huge impact on performance that comes with a well motivated and experienced workforce.</li> <li><strong>Goal 5: Provide slack to enable improvement</strong>. Without slack (space between work items), team members cannot take time to reflect upon how they do their work and how they might do it better.</li> <li><strong>Goal 6: Simplify prioritisation</strong>. Maximise business value and minimise risk and cost. In order to respond to change in the market and evolving events, it is necessary to reprioritise. What is needed is a prioritisation scheme that delays commitments as long as possible and that asks a simple question that is easy to answer. Kanban provides this by asking the business owners to refill empty slots in the queue while providing them with a reliable lead-time and due-date performance metric.</li> <li><strong>Goal 7: Provide transparency on the system design and operation</strong>. Transparency into the performance of the team, provide customers with confidence. Transparency into the process, let everyone involved see the effects of their actions or inactions. People will be more reasonable.</li> <li><strong>Goal 8: Design a process to enable emergence of “high-maturity” organisation</strong>. Seek predictability above all else, coupled with business agility and good governance. Success at the senior-executive level depends a lot on trust, and trust requires reliability.</li> </ul> <h3 id="steps-to-get-started"> <a href="#steps-to-get-started" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="steps-to-get-started"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Steps to get started </h3> <ol> <li>Map the value stream</li> <li>Define some point where you want to control input.

Observe the arrival rate and variation.</li> <li>Meet with the upstream and downstream stakeholders.</li> <li>Discuss policies around capacity and get agreement on WIP limit.</li> <li>Discuss and agree on an input-coordination mechanism, such as a regular prioritisation meeting, with the upstream partners.</li> <li>Discuss and agree on a release/delivery-coordination mechanism, such as a regular software release, with downstream partners.</li> <li>You might need to introduce the concept of different classes of service.</li> <li>Agree on a lead-time target for each class of service of work items (SLA).</li> <li>Create a board/card wall to track the value stream.</li> <li>Optionally, create an electronic system to track and report the same.</li> <li>Agree with the team to have a standup meeting every day in front of the board; invite up- and downstream stakeholders but don’t mandate their involvement.</li> <li>Agree to have a regular operations review meeting for retrospective analysis of the process; invite up- and downstream stakeholders but don’t mandate their involvement.</li> <li>Educate the team on the new board, WIP limits, and the pull system.</li> </ol> <h3 id="kanban-strikes-a-different-type-of-bargain"> <a href="#kanban-strikes-a-different-type-of-bargain" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="kanban-strikes-a-different-type-of-bargain"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Kanban strikes a different type of bargain </h3> <p>Kanban does not seek to make a promise and commit based on something that is uncertain. The typical implementation involves agreement that there will be regular delivery of high-quality working software, with complete transparency, daily visibility of progress and offering frequent opportunities to select the most important new items for development.</p> <p>A commitment around scope, schedule, and budget is indicative of a one-off transaction. It implies that there is no ongoing relationship; it implies a low level of trust.</p> <p>Kanban is based on the notion that the team will stay together and engage in a supplier relationship over a long period of time.</p> <h3 id="wip-limits"> <a href="#wip-limits" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="wip-limits"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> WIP limits </h3> <p>Getting our partners to agree on a WIP limits is a vital element. There will be a day when our partners ask us to take some additional work and we will be able to respond that we have an agreed-upon WIP limit.

On a highway analogy, speed does not really affect throughput. It’s the gap between vehicles that is most important. Variability in the system has a huge impact on throughput.</p> <p>Fortunately, in our office, our capacity-constrained resources are affected by variability that we <em>can</em> do something about. We can seek to keep the individual busy working on value-added work by minimising the non-value-added (wasteful) activities required of that person.</p> <p>If you find yourself saying “invest”, you are generally talking about an elevation action. Adding resources is not the only way to elevate capacity. <strong>Automation is a good an natural strategy for elevation.</strong> It does also reduce the variability: repeatable tasks and activities are repeated with digital accuracy.</p> <p>A strong organisational capability at issue identification, escalation, and resolution is essential for effective exploitation of capacity-constrained bottlenecks.</p> <p>If there are several issues blocking current work, they should get the highest priority. Kanban will help to raise awareness.</p> <p>One more technique is to ensure that the resource is never idle. <strong>The most common way to avoid such idle time is to protect the bottleneck resource with a buffer</strong> of work intended to absorb the variability in the arrival rate of new work queuing.

This can be addressed by directly influencing the analysis processes used to develop requirements, and by improving the capability and skill level of those defining them.</p> <h3 id="expedite-requests"> <a href="#expedite-requests" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="expedite-requests"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Expedite requests </h3> <p>Expediting is known to be bad. It affects predictability of other requests. It increases mean lead time and the spread of variability and it reduces throughput. Expediting is undesirable even if it is being done to generate value.</p> <p>One solution is to limit the number of expedite requests. By denying the business the ability to expedite anything they feel like, you force upstream people to explore opportunities early and asses them effectively.</p> <h3 id="irregular-flow-1"> <a href="#irregular-flow-1" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="irregular-flow-1"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Irregular flow </h3> <p>There are two approaches to dealing with the blocked work items issue:</p> <ul> <li>You can have a larger overall WIP limit. It will ease the flow but at the expense of lead time and possibly quality. The biggest drawback is that there is less tension to provoke discussion and implementation of improvements.</li> <li>Leave work to be block, raising awareness of the blocking issue. Encouraging those idle team members to think about the root causes and possible process changes that will reduce or eliminate the possibility of recurrence.</li> </ul> <h3 id="environment-availability"> <a href="#environment-availability" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="environment-availability"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Environment availability </h3> <p>The idle time incurred by enforcing a WIP limit has been seen to encourage collaboration on resolving problems.</p> <h3 id="difficulty-scheduling-coordination-activity"> <a href="#difficulty-scheduling-coordination-activity" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="difficulty-scheduling-coordination-activity"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Difficulty scheduling coordination activity </h3> <p>There is a challenge of coordinating external teams, stakeholders and resources. A frequent reaction is to schedule meetings with a regular cadence.</p> <p>By marking items as blocked and raising visibility on to the source of the blockage, you’ll lead some behavioural changes to improve the situation.</p> <h2 id="issue-management-and-escalation-policies"> <a href="#issue-management-and-escalation-policies" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="issue-management-and-escalation-policies"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Issue management and escalation policies </h2> <p>When an item becomes blocked, the convention is to attach a pink sticky note to the card, indicating the reason for the blockage or a red border in electronic systems.</p> <p>Blocked work items require an organisation to develop a capability for issue management.</p> <h3 id="managing-issues"> <a href="#managing-issues" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="managing-issues"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Managing issues </h3> <p>Knowing something is blocked does not lead to developing a strong capability for getting it unblocked.

A history of efforts made at resolution, a history of assigned individuals, an indication of escalation path, an estimated time to resolution, an impact assessment, and suggested root-cause fixes for future prevention may also be useful fields to track.</p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
