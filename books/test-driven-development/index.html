TDD is an awareness of the gap between decision and feedback during programming, and techniques to control that gap.</p> <p>There are certainly programming task that can’t be driven solely by tests, like security software and concurrency.</p> <blockquote> <p>My goal is to write clean code that works. Imagining a programming world in which all code was this clear and direct, where there were no complicated solutions, only apparently complicated problems begging for careful thought. TDD is a practice that can help you lead yourself exactly that careful thought.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="story-time"> <a href="#story-time" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="story-time"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Story time </h3> <p>TDD is a set of techniques any programmer can follow, that encourage simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence. <em>If you are a genius, you don’t need these rules.</em> If you are dolt, the rules won’t help.</p> <p>Two rules:</p> <ul> <li>Write a failing automated test before you write any code.</li> <li>Remove duplication</li> </ul> <h2 id="money-session"> <a href="#money-session" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="money-session"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Money session </h2> <p>The rhythm of TDD:</p> <ol> <li>Quickly add a test</li> <li>Run all the tests and see the new one fail</li> <li>Make a little change</li> <li>Run all tests and see them all succeed</li> <li>Refactor to remove duplication</li> </ol> <h4 id="create-a-test"> <a href="#create-a-test" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="create-a-test"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Create a test </h4> <p>We don’t start with objects, we start with tests.</p> <p>When we write a test, we imagine the perfect interface for our operation. We are telling ourselves a store about how the operation will look from the outside. Our story wont’ always come true, but better to start from the best possible API and work backwards than to make things complicated, ugly and “realistic” from the get go.</p> <p>You’ll might end up with multiple compile errors from a single test. It’s common to start from the following code when non of the code exists yet.</p> <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">testMultiplication</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We might need a constructor, but it doesn’t have to do anything. We might need a stub implementation for methods.</p> <p><strong>We’ll do the least work possible just to get the test to compile.</strong></p> <p>Once we solve compilation errors, we run the test and we watch it fail. Failure is progress. We’ve transformed a much broader problem to “make this test work and make the rest of the tests work”, which is in fact a much simpler and much smaller scope for fear.</p> <h4 id="make-it-pass"> <a href="#make-it-pass" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="make-it-pass"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Make it pass </h4> <p>The goal right now is not to get the perfect answer, the goal is to pass the test.</p> <h4 id="make-it-right"> <a href="#make-it-right" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="make-it-right"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Make it right </h4> <p>Dependency is the key problem in software development at all scales. If dependency is the problem, duplication is the symptom.</p> <p>Objects are excellent for abstracting away the duplication of logic. Eliminating duplication in programs eliminates dependency. By eliminating duplication before we go on the next test, we maximize our chance of being able to get the next test running with one and only one change.</p> <h3 id="degenerate-objects"> <a href="#degenerate-objects" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="degenerate-objects"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Degenerate objects </h3> <p>The general TDD cycle</p> <ol> <li><strong>Write a test.</strong> You are writing a story. Invent the interface you wish you had. Include all the elements int he story that you imagine will be necessary to calculate the right answers.</li> <li><strong>Make it run.</strong> Quickly getting that bar green dominates everything else.</li> <li><strong>Make it right.</strong> Remove the duplication you have introduced to get to quick green. The goal is clean code that works.</li> </ol> <p>Divide an conquer, solve the “that works” part, then solve the “clean code”.</p> <p>Strategies for quickly getting to green:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Fake it</strong>, return a constant and gradually replace constants with variables until you have the real code.</li> <li><strong>Obvious implementation</strong>, type in the real implementation.</li> </ul> <p>When you know what to type, go for the obvious implementation. As soon as you get the unexpected red bar, back up and shift to fake implementation and refactor to the right code. Once confidence is back, go back to obvious implementation.</p> <h3 id="equality-for-all"> <a href="#equality-for-all" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="equality-for-all"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Equality for all </h3> <p>There is a third strategy, <strong>triangulation</strong>. We briefly ignore the duplication between test and model code. When the second example demands a more general solution, then and only then do we generalize.</p> <p>Use triangulation when you are completely unsure of how to refactor.</p> <blockquote> <p>Why would I need to write another test to give me permission to write what I probably could have written the first time?</p> </blockquote> <p>Triangulation gives you a chance to think about the problem from slightly different direction. By varying the axes of variability to get a clearer answer.</p> <h3 id="privacy"> <a href="#privacy" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="privacy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Privacy </h3> <p>From time to time, our reasoning will fail us and a defeat will slip through. When that happens, we learn our lesson about the test we should have written and move on.</p> <h3 id="equality-for-all-redux"> <a href="#equality-for-all-redux" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="equality-for-all-redux"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Equality for all, redux </h3> <p>When you don’t have enough tests, you are bound to come across refactorings that aren’t supported by tests. Write the tests you wish had. If you don’t, you’ll eventually break something while refactoring.</p> <h3 id="makin-objects"> <a href="#makin-objects" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="makin-objects"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Makin’ objects </h3> <p>When you have two subclasses that aren’t doing enough work to justify their existence and you want to eliminate them, you can’t do it with one big step.</p> <p>We could be a step closer eliminating the subclasses if there were fewer references to the subclasses directly. We could use Factory Method in the parent class to remove references to the subclasses in the tests.</p> <p>By decoupling the tests from the existence of the subclasses, we have given ourselves freedom to change inheritance without affecting any model code.</p> <h3 id="time-were-livin-in"> <a href="#time-were-livin-in" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="time-were-livin-in"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Time we’re livin’ in </h3> <p>Working in tiny steps is a recommendation, if it feels restrictive take bigger steps. If you feel unsure, take smaller steps. TDD is a steering process.</p> <h3 id="interesting-times"> <a href="#interesting-times" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="interesting-times"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Interesting times </h3> <p>We end up having clean code and tests that give us confidence that the clean code works. Rather than apply minutes of suspect reasoning, we can just ask the computer by making the change and running tests.</p> <p>Without the tests you have no choice, you have to reason. With the tests you can decide whether an experiment would answer the question faster.</p> <p>We’d prefer not to write a test when we have a red bar. We can’t change model code without a test. The conservative course is back our the change that caused the red bar so we’re back to green. Then we change the test, the implementation and re-try the original change.</p> <h3 id="the-root-of-all-evil"> <a href="#the-root-of-all-evil" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-root-of-all-evil"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The root of all evil </h3> <p>When the object you have doesn’t behave like you want, make another object with the same external protocol (an Imposter) but different implementation.</p> <p>TDD can’t guarantee that you will have flashes of insight at the right moment.

You’ll have to measure and see effect TDD has on your own practice. Be sure to factor debugging, integrating, and explaining time into your metrics, though.</p> <p>TDD can be used as a way to strive for perfection, but that isn’t its most effective use. If you have a big system, the parts that you touch all the time should be absolutely rock solid, so you can make daily changes confidently.</p> <h3 id="retrospective"> <a href="#retrospective" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="retrospective"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Retrospective </h3> <blockquote> <p>I like running a code critic.

One strategy for keeping track of what we’re trying to accomplish is to hold it all in our heads.</p> <blockquote> <p>I tried this for several years, and found I got into a positive feedback loop. The more experience I accumulated, the more things I knew that might need to be done. The more things I knew might need to be done, the less attention I had for what I was doing. The less attention I had for what I was doing, the less I accomplished. The less I accomplished, the more things I knew that needed to be done.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another strategy is to try to plan everything in advance and implement tests <em>en masse</em>.</p> <p>Probably the best option is to always test first. Then we can get into a virtuous cycle: When we test first, we reduce the stress, which makes us more likely to test. The immediate payoff for testing, a design and scope control tool, suggests that we will be able to start doing it, and keep doing it even under moderate stress.</p> <h3 id="assert-first"> <a href="#assert-first" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="assert-first"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Assert first </h3> <ul> <li>Where should you start building a system?

In TDD, the circumstances we care about are the tests that are already passing. We can replace constants with variables in TDD and call this operation a refactoring because it doesn’t change the set of tests to pass.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Leap of faith</em> refactoring is exactly what we’re trying to avoid with our strategy of small steps and concrete feedback.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="mastering-tdd"> <a href="#mastering-tdd" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="mastering-tdd"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Mastering TDD </h2> <h3 id="what-dont-you-have-to-test"> <a href="#what-dont-you-have-to-test" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-dont-you-have-to-test"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What don’t you have to test? </h3> <blockquote> <p>Write tests until fear is transformed into boredom</p> </blockquote> <p>Unless you have a reason to distrust it, don’t test code from others.</p> <h3 id="how-do-you-know-if-you-have-good-tests"> <a href="#how-do-you-know-if-you-have-good-tests" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-do-you-know-if-you-have-good-tests"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How do you know if you have good tests? </h3> <p>The tests are a canary in a coal mine revealing by their distress the presence of evil vapors. Signals that your design is in trouble.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Long setup code</strong>. If you have to spend a hundred lines creating the objects for one simple assertion, something is wrong. Your objects are too big and need to be split.</li> <li><strong>Setup duplication</strong>. If you can’t easily find a common place for common setup code, there are too many objects too tightly intertwingled.</li> <li><strong>Long running tests</strong>. TDD tests that run a long time won’t be run often, and often haven’t been run for a while, and probably don’t work. Worse than this, this might suggest that testing the bits and pieces of the application is hard, and this is a design problem.</li> <li><strong>Fragile tests</strong>. Tests that break unexpectedly suggest that one part of the application is surprisingly affecting another part.</li> </ul> <h3 id="how-does-tdd-lead-to-frameworks"> <a href="#how-does-tdd-lead-to-frameworks" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-does-tdd-lead-to-frameworks"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How does TDD lead to frameworks </h3> <p>Paradox: By not considering the future of your code you make your code much more likely to be able to adapt in the future.</p> <h3 id="when-should-you-delete-tests"> <a href="#when-should-you-delete-tests" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="when-should-you-delete-tests"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> When should you delete tests? </h3> <p>Never delete a test if it reduces your confidence in the behavior of the system. If you have two tests that exercise the same path through the code, but they speak to different scenarios for readers, leave them alone.</p> <p>If you have two tests that are redundant with respect to confidence and communication, delete the least useful of the two.</p> <h3 id="how-does-the-programming-language-and-environment-influence-tdd"> <a href="#how-does-the-programming-language-and-environment-influence-tdd" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-does-the-programming-language-and-environment-influence-tdd"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How does the programming language and environment influence TDD? </h3> <p>In programming languages and environments where TDD cycles (test/compile/run/refactor) are harder to come by, you will be likely to be tempted to take larger steps.</p> <h3 id="can-you-drive-development-with-application-level-tests-atdd"> <a href="#can-you-drive-development-with-application-level-tests-atdd" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="can-you-drive-development-with-application-level-tests-atdd"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Can you drive development with application-level tests (ATDD)? </h3> <p>The problem with driving development with small scale test (“unit tests”) is that you run the risk of implementing what you think a user wants.</p> <p>If we wrote the tests at the level of the application, then the users could write tests themselves for what exactly they wanted the system to do next. There is a technical problem, how you can write and run a test for a feature that doesn’t exist yet? There is a social problem with ATDD, writing tests is a new responsibility for users and organizations resist this kind of shift of responsibility.</p> <p>TDD is a technique that is entirely under your control. Mixing up the rhythm of red/green/refactor, the technical issues of application fixturing, and the organizational change issues surrounding user-written tests is unlikely to be successful. Another aspect of ATDD is the length of the cycle between test and feedback.</p> <h3 id="how-do-you-switch-to-tdd-mid-stream"> <a href="#how-do-you-switch-to-tdd-mid-stream" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-do-you-switch-to-tdd-mid-stream"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How do you switch to TDD mid-stream? </h3> <p>The biggest problem is that code that isn’t written with tests in mind typically isn’t very testable. “Fix it”, you say. Yes, well, but refactoring (without automated toos) is likely to result in errors, errors that you won’t catch because you don’t have the tests.</p> <p>What you don’t do is go write tests for the whole thing and refactor the whole thing, that would take months.</p> <p>Parts of the system that don’t demand change at the moment we will leave them alone.</p> <p>We have to break the deadlock between tests and refactoring. We can get feedback working very carefully and with a partner. System level tests give us some confidence.</p> <h3 id="who-is-tdd-intended-for"> <a href="#who-is-tdd-intended-for" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="who-is-tdd-intended-for"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Who is TDD intended for? </h3> <p>If you are happy slamming some code together that more or less works and never looking a the same result again, TDD is not for you. TDD rests on a charmingly naive geekoid assumption that if you write better code, you’ll be more successful</p> <p>What’s naive is assuming that code is all there is to success. Good engineering is maybe 20% of a project’s success. Bad engineering will certainly sink projects, but modest engineering can enable project success as long as the other 80% liens up for it.</p> <p>Those whose souls are healed by the balm of elegance can find in TDD a way to do well by doing good. TDD is also good for geeks who form emotional attachments to code.</p> <blockquote> <p>My goal is to feel better about a project after a year than I did in the starry-eyed beginning, and TDD helps me achieve this.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="why-does-tdd-work"> <a href="#why-does-tdd-work" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="why-does-tdd-work"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Why does TDD work? </h3> <p>Let’s assume for the moment that TDD helps teams productively build loosely coupled, highly cohesive systems with low level defect rates and low cost of maintenance profiles. The sooner you find and fix a defect, the cheaper it is.</p> <p>Programmers really do relax, teams really do develop trust, and customers really do learn to look forward to new releases.</p> <p>It’s effect is the way it shortens the feedback loop on design decisions.</p> <blockquote> <p>Adopt programming practices that “attract” correct code as a limit function, not as an absolute value.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="whats-with-the-name"> <a href="#whats-with-the-name" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="whats-with-the-name"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What’s with the name? </h3> <p>One kind of the ironies of TDD is that it isn’t a testing technique, it’s an analysis technique, a design technique, really a technique for all the activities of development.</p> <h3 id="darachs-challenge"> <a href="#darachs-challenge" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="darachs-challenge"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Darach’s challenge </h3> <ul> <li>You can’t test GUIs automaticaly</li> <li>You can’t unit test distributed objects automaticaly</li> <li>You can’t test-first develop your database schema</li> <li>There is no need to test third party code</li> <li>You can’t test first develop a language compiler / interpreter.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
