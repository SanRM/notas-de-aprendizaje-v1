aria-labelledby="sizing-teams"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Sizing teams </h3> <p>The fundamental challenge of organisational design is sizing teams.</p> <p><strong>Managers should support six to eight engineers.</strong> This gives them enough time for active coaching, coordinating, and furthering their team’s mission by writing strategies, leading change and so on.</p> <ul> <li>Fewer than four engineers tend to function as <strong>Tech Lead Managers</strong>, taking on a share of design and implementation work.</li> <li>Managers supporting more than eight or nine engineers act as <strong>coaches</strong> and safety nets for problems.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Managers-of-managers should support four to six managers.</strong> This gives them enough time to coach, align with stakeholders, and to do a reasonable amount of investment in their organisation.</p> <ul> <li>Managers supporting fewer than four other managers should be in a period of active learning.</li> <li>Supporting a large team of managers leaves you functioning purely as a problem-solving coach.</li> </ul> <p><strong>On-call rotations want eight engineers.</strong> It is sometimes necessary to pool multiple teams together to reach the eight engineers necessary for a 24/7 on-call rotation.</p> <p><strong>Small teams (&lt; 4 members) are not teams.</strong> Fewer than four individuals are sufficiently leaky abstraction that they function indistinguishably from individuals. A few tips:</p> <ul> <li>Teams should be six to eight during steady state.</li> <li>To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten, and then bud into two teams of four or five.</li> <li>Never create empty teams.</li> <li>Never leave managers supporting more than eight individuals.</li> </ul> <h3 id="staying-on-the-path-to-high-performing-teams"> <a href="#staying-on-the-path-to-high-performing-teams" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="staying-on-the-path-to-high-performing-teams"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Staying on the path to high-performing teams </h3> <p>Four stages of a team</p> <ul> <li><strong>A team is falling behind</strong> if each week their backlog is longer than it was the week before. To fix this, hire new people and increase capacity.</li> <li><strong>A team is treading water</strong> if they’re able to get their critical work done, but are not able to paying down technical debt or begin major new projects. To fix this, consolidate team efforts to finish more things, and reduce concurrent work until able to begin repaying debt.</li> <li><strong>A team is repaying debt</strong> when they’re able to start paying down tech debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt repayment snowball. To fix this, add time to pay debt.</li> <li><strong>A team is innovating</strong> when their technical debt is sustainably low, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user needs. To fix this maintain enough slack in your team’s schedule so that the team can build quality into their work.</li> </ul> <p>For each constraint, prioritise one team at a time, this is particularly important for hiring.</p> <p>Adding new individuals to a team disrupt the team. It is much easier to have rapid growth periods for any given team, followed by consolidation/gelling periods.</p> <h3 id="a-case-against-top-down-global-optimisation"> <a href="#a-case-against-top-down-global-optimisation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="a-case-against-top-down-global-optimisation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> A case against top-down global optimisation </h3> <h4 id="team-first"> <a href="#team-first" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="team-first"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Team first </h4> <p>Sustained productivity comes from high-performing teams, be hesitant to disassemble them.</p> <p>A proposed model is to rapidly hiring into teams loaded down by technical debt, not into innovating teams, which avoids incurring re-gelling costs on high-performing teams.</p> <h4 id="fixed-costs"> <a href="#fixed-costs" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="fixed-costs"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Fixed costs </h4> <p>Moving one person can shift an innovating team back into falling behind.</p> <h4 id="slack"> <a href="#slack" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="slack"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Slack </h4> <p>Don’t add more resources to a team with visible slack, inverse does not apply.</p> <p>In defence of having slack, teams put spare capacity to great use by improving areas within their aegis, in bot incremental and novel ways.</p> <h4 id="shift-scope-rotate"> <a href="#shift-scope-rotate" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="shift-scope-rotate"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Shift scope; rotate </h4> <p>It’s more fruitful to move scope between teams. If a team has significant slack, then incrementally move responsibility to them.</p> <p>Another approach is to rotate individuals for a fixed period into an area that needs help.</p> <h3 id="productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth"> <a href="#productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Productivity in the age of hypergrowth </h3> <h4 id="more-engineers-more-problems"> <a href="#more-engineers-more-problems" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="more-engineers-more-problems"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> More engineers, more problems </h4> <p>Integrating large numbers of engineers is hard. The challenge depends on how quickly you can ramp engineers up ot self-sufficient productivity. You can quickly find a scenario in which untrained engineers increasingly outnumber the trained ones.</p> <p>It is not just training and hiring tho:</p> <ol> <li>For every additional order of magnitude of engineers, you need to design and maintain a new layer of management.</li> <li>For every ~10 engineers, you need an additional team and more coordination.</li> <li>You’ll need to improve your development tools</li> <li>More deployments drive more outages.</li> <li>Relative time invested in on-call goes up.</li> </ol> <p>At high enough rates, the marginal added value of hiring gets very slow, especially if your training process is weak.</p> <h4 id="systems-survive-one-magnitude-of-growth"> <a href="#systems-survive-one-magnitude-of-growth" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="systems-survive-one-magnitude-of-growth"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Systems survive one magnitude of growth </h4> <p>If your company is designing systems to last one order of magnitude and doubling every six months, then you’ll have to re-implement every system twice every three years.</p> <p>The real productivity killer is not the system rewrites, but the migrations that follow up those rewrites.</p> <h4 id="ways-to-manage-entropy"> <a href="#ways-to-manage-entropy" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="ways-to-manage-entropy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Ways to manage entropy </h4> <p>You only get value from projects when they finish. When your company has decided that is going to grow you cannot stop it from growing. However, you absolutely can concentrate that growth, such that your teams alternate between periods of rapid hiring and periods of consolidation and gelling.</p> <p>Companies do major investments in both new-hire bootcamps and recurring educational classes.</p> <p>If you could get training down to four weeks, imagine how quickly you could hire without overwhelming the existing team!</p> <p>Create a rotation for people who are available to answer questions, and train your team not to answer other forms of interruptions. It may be useful to define an <em>ownership registry</em> and document who owns what.</p> <p>The best solution to frequent interruptions is a culture of documentation, optimised for reading and searching.</p> <p>The most important opportunity is designing your software to be flexible. If you are going to rewrite your systems every few years due to increased scale, let’s avoid any unnecessary rewrites.</p> <p>An anti-pattern is the gatekeeper pattern. Having people who perform gatekeeping activities create very odd social dynamics, build systems with sufficient isolation so when they occasionally fail, make sure that they fail with a limited blast radius.</p><hr /> <p>As a closing though, the way you handle urgent project requests when you’re already underwater is by learning to say no.</p> <h3 id="where-to-stash-your-organisation-risk"> <a href="#where-to-stash-your-organisation-risk" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="where-to-stash-your-organisation-risk"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Where to stash your organisation risk? </h3> <p>The idea of <em>organisational debt</em> is sibling of <em>technical debt</em>, for example a toxic culture, struggling leader, etc.</p> <p>These problems bubble up from your peers, skip-level one-on-ones, and organisational health surveys.</p> <p>Identify a few areas to improve, ensure you’re making progress on those, and give yourself permission to do the rest poorly.</p> <p>It’s best to only delegate solvable risk.

If you cannot find someone, identify a handful of individuals who could potentially take over.</p> <p>Filter the gaps down to two lists:</p> <ol> <li><em>Easiest gaps to close</em>, It may require a written document or quick introduction.</li> <li><em>Riskiest gaps</em>, areas where you’re uniquely valuable to the company.</li> </ol> <p>Write up a plan to close all of the easy gaps and <em>onw or two</em> the riskiest gaps.

It also gives everyone an opportunity to be part of the discussion.</li> <li><strong>Brining learning to the full group</strong> Give each group an opportunity to bring their discussions back to the larger group.</li> <li><strong>Chose topics that people already know about.</strong> Successful topics are ones that people have already thought about.</li> <li><strong>Encourage tenured folks to attend.</strong> You’ll find that the most senior or most tenured folks opt out to focus on other work.</li> <li><strong>Optional pre-reads.</strong> Providing a list of optional pre-reads can help them prepare for the discussion.</li> <li><strong>Checking in.</strong> Have each person give a 20 or 30-second self-introduction.

Folks often look at new roles as less important. Sometimes are intended to reduce work for another role as opposed to having an empowering mission of their own.</li> <li><strong>Brittle organisation</strong>. As you move away from generalised roles and toward specialists, your organisation has far more single points of failure.</li> <li><strong>Pattern matching</strong>. Folks pattern match on how they’ve seen the role done elsewhere. People will avoid taking any steps to learn how the role is intended to function.</li> <li><strong>Task offloading</strong>. Individuals will view it as an opportunity to offload tasks that they find challenging, difficult or uninteresting.</li> <li><strong>Roles too “trivial” to value</strong>. Many roles start by taking on work that is viewed uninteresting. Individuals tend to view that work as trivial and unimportant.</li> <li><strong>Roles too “trivial” to promote</strong>. The work done by new roles is often valued very highly, but not viewed sufficiently “strategic” to merit promotion.</li> <li><strong>Head count obstacles</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Recruiting rare humans</strong>. People want the first hire for a new role to be a strong role model, which usually makes impossible for any candidate to pass the bar.</li> <li><strong>Inability to evaluate</strong>. The existing organisation has so little experience with the new function that don’t know how to properly evaluate.

Find an authorised, senior leader who is committed to the success of the new function. If you can’t find a sponsor, it may mean that leadership doesn’t believe on the new role.</li> <li><strong>Recruiting partner</strong>. Make sure that your recruiting team is able to support a new role.</li> <li><strong>Self-sustaining mission</strong>. You might describe TPMs as offloading project management responsibilities for engineering managers. This frames the role as auxiliary, which makes it difficult to recognise impact. You must be able to frame the role’s work without referencing other existing roles in order for it to succeed long-term.</li> <li><strong>Career ladder</strong>. New roles should have a career ladder from the beginning, this is the foundation of a successful performance management.</li> <li><strong>Role model</strong>. You want to have a person you can point to.</li> <li><strong>Dedicated calibrations</strong>. Sometimes managers try to perform calibration with mixed roles in a single session, which leads to smaller roles being treated as afterthoughts. Consider dedicated calibration sessions for the one role, or consider all smaller roles together.</li> </ul> <h4 id="advantages"> <a href="#advantages" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="advantages"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Advantages </h4> <p>Creating a new role has some advantages:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>. Specialised roles are able to spend more time doing a smaller set of tasks, which leads to great expertise that can be translated in significantly more overall throughput without increasing head count.</li> <li><strong>Efficiency solve constraints</strong>. You can add exactly the kind of capacity you are missing. If your organisation is low on project management bandwidth, you could add five new managers who can each other take on a bit of it, or you might be able to add a single project manager who individually adds as much relevant bandwidth as the five managers combined.</li> <li><strong>Recognition</strong>. It provides additional structural mechanisms to support recognition.</li> <li><strong>Evaluating for strengths</strong>. It’s often challenging to interview specialists because you’ll typically evaluate them based on your generalist position. Creating a new role makes it possible to target the interview process on the ares that are most important.</li> <li><strong>Increased hiring pool</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Specialised compensation</strong>.</li> </ul> <h4 id="what-to-do"> <a href="#what-to-do" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-to-do"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What to do </h4> <p><strong>Create a new role if it immediately be covered with at least 20 individuals, be reluctant to create a new role if it would take 2 years to hire 20 individuals.</strong></p> <h3 id="designing-an-interview-loop"> <a href="#designing-an-interview-loop" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="designing-an-interview-loop"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Designing an interview loop </h3> <ul> <li><strong>Metrics first</strong>.

Review the funnel metrics to see how it’s working out.</li> <li><strong>Schedule an annual refresh</strong>. Schedule a review for a year out.</li> </ul> <p>A few more general pieces of guidance:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Try to avoid design by committee</strong>.

It should cover longer-term goals of the team (user adoption, revenue, return users, etc.), and the operational baselines necessary to know if the team is functioning well (on-call load, incidents, availability, cost, etc.). The dashboard should make things clear: the current value, the goal value, and the trend between them.</p> <p>Your staff meetings can start with a quick metrics review to give a sense of whether there is somewhere you need to drill in. You can focus your attention on projects that are exceeding or struggling.</p> <p>Another interesting mechanism is <strong>team snippets</strong>. Every two to four weeks give snapshots of each team’s sprints: what are they doing, and what they’re planning to do next.</p> <h3 id="useful-books"> <a href="#useful-books" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="useful-books"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Useful books </h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems">Thinking in Systems: A Primer</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13455.Don_t_Think_of_an_Elephant_Know_Your_Values_and_Frame_the_Debate">Don’t Think of an Elephant!
