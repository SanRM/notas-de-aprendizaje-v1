Code becomes more generic by becoming more abstract. One way to make code more abstract is to DRY it out.</p> <p><strong>DRY is important but if applied to early, and with too much vigour, it can do more harm than good.</strong> It’s a good idea to ask the following questions when doing so:</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Does the change I’m contemplating make the code harder to understand?</em> Be suspicious of any change that muddies the waters.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>What is the future cost of doing nothing now?</em> Some changes cost the same regardless of whether you make them now or delay them until later. <strong>If it doesn’t increase your costs, delay making changes.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><em>When will the future arrive, or how soon will I get more information?</em> It’s better to tolerate duplication than to anticipate the wrong abstraction.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Writing Shameless Green means optimising for understandability, not changeability, and patiently tolerating duplication if doing so will help reveal the underlying abstraction.</p> <h3 id="exposing-responsibilities"> <a href="#exposing-responsibilities" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="exposing-responsibilities"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Exposing responsibilities </h3> <p><strong>Duplication is useful when it supplies independent, specific examples of a general concept that you don’t yet understand.</strong></p> <p>A specific method is responsible for understanding its input arguments, and for knowing how to use these arguments to produce the correct output. Responsibilities out of the scope of the method itself it should be delegated to other parts of the system.</p> <p>When the obvious implementation is evident, it makes sense to jump straight to it. If you are absolutely certain of the correct implementation, there is no need to wear a hair shirt and repetitively inch through a series of tiny steps.</p> <p>The small steps of TDD act to incrementally reveal the correct implementation. If your absolute certainty turns out to be wrong, <strong>skipping these incremental steps means you miss the opportunity of being set right.</strong></p> <p>Developing the habit of writing just enough code to pass the tests forces you to write better tests.</p> <h3 id="choosing-names"> <a href="#choosing-names" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="choosing-names"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Choosing names </h3> <p>Knowledge that one object has about another creates a dependency.

When using inheritance, you must be able to freely substitute an instance of a subclass for an instance of its superclass. Subclasses, by definition, are all their superclasses, <em>plus more</em>, so this substitution should always work.</p> <p>Liskov Substitution Principle also applies to duck types. When relying on duck types, every object that asserts that it plays the duck’s role must completely implement the duck’s API. Duck types should be substitutable for one another.</p> <p>Liskov violations force message senders to have knowledge of the various return types, and to either treat them differently or convert them into something consistent.</p> <h3 id="taking-bigger-steps"> <a href="#taking-bigger-steps" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="taking-bigger-steps"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Taking bigger steps </h3> <p>If you take bigger steps and the tests begin to fail, there’s something about the problem that you don’t understand.

They <em>name</em> this consolidated code, allowing the name to be used as a shortcut for an idea, independent of its current implementation. These are valuable benefits, but abstractions also help in another, more subtle, way. In addition to the above, abstractions tell you where the code <em>relies</em> upon an idea.

Most obviously, it narrows the range of things that meet the condition.</strong> This reduces the difficulty of debugging errors. Testing of equality also makes the code more precise, and this precision enables future refactorings.</p> <p>As an OO practitioner, when you see a conditional, the hairs on your neck should stand up. It means that objects are missing, and suggests that subsequent refactorigns are needed to reveal them.</p> <p>This is not to say that you’ll never have a conditional in an object-oriented application. <strong>Collaborators must be brought together in useful combinations, and assembling these combinations requires knowing which objects are suitable.</strong> Some object, somewhere, must choose which objects to create, and this often involves a conditional.</p> <p>There is a big difference between a conditional that selects the correct object and one that supplies behaviour.
