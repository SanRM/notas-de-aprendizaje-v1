The common approach to testing a stateful system is to start up such that it is in some kind of “clean” or “initial” state, perform the desired tests upon the assumption that the system would perform in the same way every time the test is run. Sweeping the problem of state under the carpet.</p> <p>It’s not <em>always</em> possible to “get away with it”, some sequence of events can cause the system to “get into a bad <em>state</em>”, then thing can go wrong.</p> <p>Even though the number of <em>inputs</em> may be very large, the number of possible <em>states</em> the system can be is often even larger.</p> <h4 id="impact-of-state-in-informal-reasoning"> <a href="#impact-of-state-in-informal-reasoning" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="impact-of-state-in-informal-reasoning"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Impact of state in informal reasoning </h4> <p>The mental processes which are used to do this informal reasoning often revolve around a case-by-case mental simulation of behaviour. As the number of states grows, the effectiveness of this mental approach buckles quickly.</p> <p>Another issue for informal reasoning is <em>contamination</em>.</p> <p>Consider a system made up of procedures, some of which are stateful and others which aren’t. If the procedure makes use of any procedure which <em>is</em> stateful, <em>even indirectly</em>, the procedure becomes <em>contaminated</em>.</p> <p>The more we can do to <em>limit</em> and <em>manage</em> state, the better.</p> <h3 id="complexity-caused-by-control"> <a href="#complexity-caused-by-control" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="complexity-caused-by-control"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Complexity caused by control </h3> <p>Control is about <em>order</em> in which things happen. We do not want to have to concerned about this.</p> <p>When control is an implicit part of the language, every single piece of program must be understood in that context. When a programmer is forced to specify the control, he or she is being forced to specify an aspect of <em>how</em> the system should work rather than simply <em>what</em> is desired. They are being forced to <em>over-specify</em> the problem.</p> <p>A control-related problem is concurrency, which affects <em>testing</em> as well.</p> <p>Concurrency is normally specified <em>explicitly</em> in most languages. The most common model is “shared-state concurrency” in which explicit synchronisation is provided. The difficulty for informal reasoning comes from adding further the <em>number of scenarios</em> that must mentally be considered as the program is read.</p> <p>Running a test in the presence of concurrency tells you <em>nothing at all</em> about what will happen the next time you run that very same test.</p> <h3 id="complexity-caused-by-code-volume"> <a href="#complexity-caused-by-code-volume" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="complexity-caused-by-code-volume"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Complexity caused by code volume </h3> <p>This is a secondary effect. Much code is simply concerned with managing <em>state</em> or specifying <em>control</em>. It is the easiest form of complexity to <em>measure</em>, and it interacts badly with the other causes of complexity.</p> <p>Complexity definitively <em>does</em> exhibit nonlinear increase with size (of the code) so it’s vital to reduce the amount of code to an absolute minimum.</p> <h3 id="other-causes-of-complexity"> <a href="#other-causes-of-complexity" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="other-causes-of-complexity"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Other causes of complexity </h3> <p>There are other causes like: duplicated code, dead code, unnecessary abstraction, missed abstraction, poor modularity, poor documentation…</p> <p>All these come down to the following principles</p> <ul> <li><strong>Complexity breeds complexity</strong>. Complexity introduced as a <em>result of</em> not being able to clearly understand a system, like <em>Duplication</em>. This is particularly common in the presence of time pressures.</li> <li><strong>Simplicity is hard</strong>. Simplicity can only be attained if it is recognised, sought and priced.</li> <li><strong>Power corrupts</strong>. In the absence of language-enforced guarantees mistakes (and abuses) <em>will</em> happen. We need to be very wary of any language that even <em>permits</em> state, regardless of how much it discourages its use, the more <em>powerful</em> a language, the harder it is to <em>understand</em> systems constructed in it.</li> </ul> <h2 id="classical-approaches-to-managing-complexity"> <a href="#classical-approaches-to-managing-complexity" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="classical-approaches-to-managing-complexity"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Classical approaches to managing complexity </h2> <h3 id="object-orientation"> <a href="#object-orientation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="object-orientation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Object-orientation </h3> <p>Imperative approach to programming.</p> <h4 id="state"> <a href="#state" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="state"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> State </h4> <p>An object is seen as consisting of some state together with a set of procedures for accessing and manipulating that state.</p> <p><em>Encapsulation</em> allows the enforcement of integrity constraints over an object’s state by regulating access to that state through access procedures (“methods”).</p> <p>One problem is that if several of the access procedures access or manipulate the same bit of state, then there may be several places where a given constraint must be enforced. Another major problem is that encapsulation-based integrity constraint enforcement is strongly biased toward single-object constraints, and it’s awkward to enforce more complicated constraints involving multiple objects.</p> <h5 id="identity-and-state"> <a href="#identity-and-state" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="identity-and-state"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Identity and state </h5> <p>Each object is seen as being uniquely identifiable entity regardless of its attributes.

It is common to start using custom access procedures to determine whether two objects are equivalent. There is no guarantee that such domain-specific equivalence concepts conform to the standard idea of an equivalence relation (peg: no guarantee of transitivity).</p> <p>The concept of <em>object identity</em> adds complexity to the task of reasoning about systems developed in OOP.</p> <h5 id="state-in-oop"> <a href="#state-in-oop" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="state-in-oop"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> State in OOP </h5> <p>All forms of OOP rely on state, and general behaviour is affected by this state.
